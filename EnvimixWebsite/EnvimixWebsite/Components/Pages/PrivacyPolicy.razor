        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
            ENVIMIX project ("the Service," "we," "us," or "our") is a community-driven platform for TrackMania and ManiaPlanet players that provides record tracking, leaderboards, and title pack distribution services.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Service is part of the gbx.tools ecosystem and relies on <a href="https://identity.gbx.tools">identity.gbx.tools</a> for user authentication and identity management. We do not operate our own account system and do not store credentials.

            When you sign in on envimix.gbx.tools, we use a secure, shared authentication cookie issued by identity.gbx.tools to verify your identity. This cookie is essential and we may use it to request additional data from the identity manager as needed to provide functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            All identity-related data processing, including OAuth provider data, cookies, and account management, is governed by the <a href="https://identity.gbx.tools/privacy">identity.gbx.tools Privacy Policy</a>.
